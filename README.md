# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

My name is Nadia Ferguson and I'm currently a product manager for an ITAM solution company. 

I want to learn more about coding and UX because I work so closely with design and development teams, but half the time I feel lost when they’re talking through the development process. Taking this course feels like a good way to fill in those gaps, build up my skills, and have better conversations with the people I work with every day.

Eventually, I’d love to take what I learn and use it to build out my own product ideas.
